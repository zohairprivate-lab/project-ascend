## Setup Instructions

Since this code was generated without using the Flutter CLI (as it wasn't detected in your active path), you need to create a valid Flutter project shell first.

1.  **Open a Terminal** (where `flutter` command is recognized).
2.  **Create a New Project**:
    ```bash
    flutter create simple_nav_app
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the folder**:
    ```bash
    cd simple_nav_app
    ```
4.  **Replace `lib/main.dart`**:
    -   Copy the content of `main.dart` provided in this folder.
    -   Overwrite the generated `lib/main.dart` inside your new project with this file.

## Running the App

```bash
flutter run
```
